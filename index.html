                <p>Great Men in History was originally formed in January of 2008 on Destromath and rerolled on Proudmoore in September of 2015. Many of our members started playing in Vanilla, and we're a "serious raiding guild"-turned-"casual raiding guild" (with the love of min-maxing firmly intact). We're a mature group of players looking for friendly (and competent) team members to fill out our roster for Legion.</p>
