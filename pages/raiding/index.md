## Raid Roster

Our raid roster will generally consist of Legionnaires with the occasional trial member. Once raids are on farm, we’ll open up opportunities for raiding to prepared social members.

## Raiding Expectations
- Invites start going out at 5:45pm PST. Please be in the raid zone by 6pm PST and ready to pull.
- Maintain a reasonable rate of attendance (75%+).
- ilvl 875+
- Artifact Traits at 35+
- Study up on strategies before the raid. GMiH strats will be posted on the forums and you can feel free to ask any questions or discuss any concerns you have there.
- Install and use Ventrilo.
- Install and use the following addons:
  - [DBM](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/deadly-boss-mods)
  - Future encounter-specific addons as needed
- Have a good attitude. Everyone gets frustrated, but don’t take it out on your teammates.
- RSVP to raids using the in-game calendar. RSVP by midnight each Wednesday to secure your raid spot.
- We highly encourage all of our raiders to run Mythic+ dungeons regularly.

### Attendance

Great Men in History expects that Legionnaires will maintain an attendance record of 75% or higher over a 2 month period of time (6 out of 8 points). If your attendance drops below 75%, you’ll be notified by an officer. From there, you can either get your attendance back up, or be moved into another rank.

Every week, you can earn a maximum of 1 attendance point. This point can come from attending either a Friday or Saturday raid. We expect that you'll try to make as many raids as you can, but we don't want to penalize you for having an off schedule.

If you’re going to miss a raid, please post in the “Truancy” sub-forum as soon as possible.

An updated Attendance record can be found in the Link section on the forum sidebar.

### Behavior
- While we are a mature guild that allows mature (or rather immature) humor and profanity, please help keep the guild a harassment-free space for everyone. Great Men in History prohibits harassment based on performance, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). If someone asks you to stop, or you’re lashing out in anger, be willing to apologize and move on.

- If you are having issues with another raid member, please contact an officer to resolve the issue.

- Contact officers with your concerns after (not during) raids, so we can properly give your issue the attention it deserves.

- Act maturely and responsibly in and outside of raid. You are a representative of our guild, and our guild treats everyone with respect.

### Performance
Great Men in History has a limited raid schedule, so it’s incredibly important that everyone comes prepared and ready to perform. We’re happy to help our guildies out as much as possible. Check the forums for more information about strategies, class discussion, and useful addons/resources.

#### Guidelines for Great Raiding

- Know your class. 
  - Use your potions, healthstones, dispels, cooldowns, etc.
  - Keep up with your Artifact Points.
  - Perform well with respect to your class and role. If you’re having issues getting to where you think you should be performing, please get in touch with an officer for tips, guidelines, and help with learning strategies.
  - Research your class and be aware of which specs are underperforming. Spec accordingly.
  - Talk to your fellow teammates. Sharing what works and what doesn’t is how we all get better.
- Know the fights.
  - Follow raid directions. Everyone makes mistakes, and it’s important to learn from them and take them seriously.
  - Read/watch strategies and participate in forum discussions when possible.
  - Keep strategy discussion out of raid. That’s what the forums are for.
- Come prepared.
  - Come to raid equipped with flasks, potions, food, and any other consumable that may boost your performance.
  - The guild will help provide these as much as possible.

## Loot
Loot is given out to raid members based on the following criteria:

### Main Spec Upgrades

Every core raider is equally deserving of loot, and so we reward loot based on your loot history. Loot History is simply a snapshot of how much gear you've received vs how many raids you've been able to attend. It’s important to us that people feel rewarded for the time they spend in raids. This number will be reset for each raid tier.

Raid members will speak up when they see an item that they want, and the item will be awarded based on your loot history. If there's a Loot History tie, raid members will roll for the upgrade. An updated account of the guild's Loot History can be found in the Link section of the forum sidebar.

### Offspec, Sidegrade, and Transmog — Roll-off
- Official Offspec Raider > Sidegrade > Transmog
  - Official Offspec Raiders are people who perform multiple roles in our guild. (For example, we may have a designated off-tank and off-healer to help with raid progression.)

If you’re unhappy with a loot decision, contact the Loot Master (Crowlle) after raid in-game or by forum PM to explain your concern. From there, officers will discuss the issue and get back to you. It's important for us to hear your concerns and make our loot system better over time.
