## Legion Raid Progression

Between August 30th and September 23rd, guildies will spend their time leveling up to 110 and gearing up to around ilvl 840 while catching up on sleep at work. Our first raid will be on September 23rd where we will raid the Emerald Nightmare on Normal mode. 

We plan to raid Normal mode Emerald Nightmare for two weeks, and then switch to Heroic. This timing will depend on our raid readiness for the transition to Heroic.

Once we’ve cleared Heroic, we’ll discuss transitioning to Mythic raiding as a guild.

### Raid Roster
All attendance numbers will be reset in Legion, and the main raid roster will be decided by September 23rd based on the following criteria:

- Member of the forums
- Level 110
- Around ilvl 840
- Raid viable spec

We will aim to keep our roster to around 20 regular raiders. Our raid roster will generally consist of Legionnaires with Citizens added on a case-by-case basis. Once raids are on farm, we’ll open up opportunities for raiding to prepared alts and social members.

The Friday Night raid roster will be decided on Thursday in order to give everyone advance notice.

### Mythic+ Dungeon Groups
As Mythic+ dungeons are an alternative gearing path, Great Men in History will help to organize groups on a weekly basis. All guild members interested in this Mythic+ matching will fill out a weekly survey with their schedule so that matches can be made the Sunday before each reset.

## Raiding Expectations
- Invites start going out at 5:45pm PST. Please be in the raid zone by 6pm PST and ready to pull.
- Maintain a reasonable rate of attendance (75%+). This means attending 3 raids every month.
- Study up on strategies before the raid. GMiH strats will be posted on the forums and you can feel free to ask any questions or discuss any concerns you have there.
- Install and use Ventrilo.
- Install and use the following addons:
  - [RCLootCouncil](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/rclootcouncil) (No loot given out to those who don’t have this addon).
  - [DBM](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/deadly-boss-mods)
  - Future encounter-specific addons as needed
- Have a good attitude. Everyone gets frustrated, but don’t take it out on your teammates.
- RSVP to raids using the in-game calendar. RSVP by midnight each Wednesday to secure your raid spot.
- We highly encourage all of our raiders to run Mythic+ dungeons regularly.

### Attendance
Great Men in History expects that Legionnaires will maintain an attendance record of 75% or higher over a 2 month period of time. If your attendance drops below 75%, you’ll be notified by an officer. From there, you can either get your attendance back up, or be moved into another rank.

If you’re going to miss a raid, please post in the “Truancy” sub-forum as soon as possible.

### Behavior
- While we are a mature guild that allows mature (or rather immature) humor and profanity, please help keep the guild a harassment-free space for everyone. Great Men in History prohibits harassment based on performance, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). If someone asks you to stop, or you’re lashing out in anger, be willing to apologize and move on.

- If you are having issues with another raid member, please contact an officer to resolve the issue.

- Contact officers with your concerns after (not during) raids, so we can properly give your issue the attention it deserves.

- Act maturely and responsibly in and outside of raid. You are a representative of our guild, and our guild treats everyone with respect.

### Performance
Great Men in History only has 1 raid night each week, so it’s incredibly important that everyone comes prepared and ready to perform. We’re happy to help our guildies out as much as possible. Check the forums for more information about strategies, class discussion, and useful addons/resources.

#### Guidelines for Great Raiding

- Know your class. 
  - Use your potions, healthstones, dispels, cooldowns, etc.
  - Perform well with respect to your class and role. If you’re having issues getting to where you think you should be performing, please get in touch with an officer for tips, guidelines, and help with learning strategies.
  - Research your class and be aware of which specs are underperforming. Spec accordingly.
  - Talk to your fellow teammates. Sharing what works and what doesn’t is how we all get better.
- Know the fights.
  - Follow raid directions. Everyone makes mistakes, and it’s important to learn from them and take them seriously.
  - Read/watch strategies and participate in forum discussions when possible.
  - Keep strategy discussion out of raid. That’s what the forums are for.
- Come prepared.
  - Come to raid equipped with flasks, potions, food, and any other consumable that may boost your performance.
  - The guild will help provide these as much as possible.

## Loot
We will use Personal Loot for Normal Raiding. We will continue to use Loot Council for Heroic and Mythic Raiding. While Personal Loot has its charms, it gets a bit messy after each boss.

Raid members will create a “Best in Slot” list based on guidelines from the Loot Master. Raid members must have a BiS list in order to be considered for loot. More information on how to submit your BiS list will be coming soon.

We use RCLootCouncil to handle loot in raids. Please make sure to install it so you can get loot.

Loot is given out to raid members based on the following criteria:

### Best in Slot and Main Spec Upgrades

- Legionnaire > Citizen > Gladiator > Social
- BiS > MS Upgrade
- Loot History 
  - Your loot history will be a snapshot of how often you’ve received gear in the past compared to someone else. Only BiS and MS upgrades count toward your loot score.
  - This number will be reset for each raid tier.

### Offspec, Sidegrade, and Transmog — Roll-off
- Official Offspec Raider > Sidegrade > Transmog
  - Official Offspec Raiders are people who perform multiple roles in our guild. (For example, we may have 1-2 designated off-tanks who run Mythic+ dungeons as tanks for guild groups, but who raid as DPS.) Citizens have the same priority as Legionnaires do for offspec, sidegrades, and transmog gear.

If you’re unhappy with a loot decision, contact the Loot Master (Savv) after raid in-game or by forum PM to explain your concern. From there, officers will discuss the issue and get back to you.
