Great Men in History is a semi-casual raiding guild. We raid every Friday night from 6pm - 9pm PST and we regularly run Mythic dungeons.

Originally formed in January of 2008 on Destromath, Great Men in History rerolled as an Alliance guild on Proudmoore in September of 2015. Many of our members started playing in Vanilla, and we’re a “serious raiding guild”-turned-”casual raiding guild” (with the love of min-maxing firmly intact). We’re a mature group of players looking for friendly (and competent) team members to fill out our roster for Legion raiding.

The Great Scrabble Champion Odysseus “Ecplecticos” (Google that one for lols) came up with this name and now we’re stuck with it.  Characters named after hilarious or unfortunate historical figures are encouraged though not required. **All genders welcome.**

## Guild Ranks

### César - Guild Master
Milou, like any good dictator, was once voted into this position but failed to ever relinquish it.  Luckily he is supported by some excellent officers so he can focus on conjuring various spirits from his icy throne (or fiery/arcany...whichever gets buffs).

### Senator - Guild Officer
These members contribute to the guild in special roles and help keep the guild running.

- Milou
  - GM
  - Raid Lead
  - Master Looter
  - Official t-minus score keeper.
- Rissie
  - Guild/Raid Organizer
  - Healing Lead
  - Tintin’s Dog Walker
- Interficiens
  - Recruitment Officer
  - Melee Lead
  - Official Bookkeeper

### Legionnaire - Core Raid Member
Legionnaires are our core raid members. They show up on time and prepared, rarely have to miss a raid night, and perform to the level expected of them given their role and class. In return, they get free guild repairs.

Rank changes to Legionnaire are discussed after raids and are based on not only meeting minimum ilvl but performing well and meeting attendance goals.

### Social
This is our friends and family guild rank, and members will need to let an officer know that they want to raid and go through a short trial to become a Legionnaire.

### Senator Servant
Officer Alts.

### Servant
Legionnaire and Social Alts. 

### Gladiator
Gladiators are new guild members who are trialing to become Legionnaires. After a 4-raid probationary period, they can become full-fledged Legionnaires.
