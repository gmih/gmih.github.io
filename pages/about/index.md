Great Men in History is a semi-casual raiding guild. We raid every Friday night from 6pm - 9pm PST and we regularly run Mythic dungeons.

Originally formed in January of 2008 on Destromath, Great Men in History rerolled as an Alliance guild on Proudmoore in September of 2015. Many of our members started playing in Vanilla, and we’re a “serious raiding guild”-turned-”casual raiding guild” (with the love of min-maxing firmly intact). We’re a mature group of players looking for friendly (and competent) team members to fill out our roster for Legion raiding.

The Great Scrabble Champion Odysseus “Ecplecticos” (Google that one for lols) came up with this name and now we’re stuck with it.  Characters named after hilarious or unfortunate historical figures are encouraged though not required. **All genders welcome.**

## Guild Ranks

### César - Guild Master
Milou, like any good dictator, was once voted into this position but failed to ever relinquish it.  Luckily he is supported by some excellent officers so he can focus on conjuring various spirits from his fiery throne (or icy/arcany...whichever gets buffs).

### Senator - Guild Officer
These members contribute to the guild in special roles and help keep the guild running.

- Milou
  - GM
  - Raid Lead
  - Official t-minus score keeper.
- Rissie
  - Guild/Raid Organizer
  - Healing Lead
  - Tintin’s Dog Walker
- Interficiens
  - Recruitment Officer
  - Melee Lead
  - Official Bookkeeper
- Savv
  - Master Looter
  - Keeper of all things Krap


### Legionnaire - Core Raid Member
Legionnaires are our core raid members. They show up on time and prepared, rarely have to miss a raid night, and perform to the level expected of them given their role and class. In return, they get free guild repairs and are guaranteed a raiding spot.

### Citizen - Raid Ready Members
Citizens are members of the guild who meet the minimum requirements to raid (ilvl, gemmed/enchanted, etc.) but can’t make the 75% attendance requirement or need some additional guidance with their raid performance.

Citizens are welcome to move into the Legionnaire rank, and will need to PM an officer so that we can start the process. Once the officers discuss the rank change and reach a consensus, we’ll either give you Legionnaire rank or give you some concrete feedback to work on.

We’d love to help every Citizen become a Legionnaire when and if they want to. If we have concerns, we’ll provide you with guidance and resources so that you know exactly what you can work on.

### Social
This is our friends and family guild rank, and members will need to let an officer know that they want to raid and go through a short trial to become a Citizen or Legionnaire.

### Senator Servant
Officer Alts.

### Servant
Legionnaire, Citizen, and Social Alts. 

### Gladiator
Gladiators are new guild members who are trialing to become Legionnaires. They can become official guild members after 2 raids, and then move into Legionnaire rank after a 2 raid probationary period.
